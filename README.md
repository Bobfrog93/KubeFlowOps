# KubeFlowOps

KubeFlowOps is a Kubernetes Operator built and designed to manage custom workflows and application lifecycles in Kubernetes. This project aims to provide an automated, scalable, and user-friendly solution for handling complex operational tasks, multi-cluster deployments, monitoring, and integration with GitOps workflows.
As multi-cluster and multi-cloud environments dominate the technology space, ensuring the security of key services remains critical.

## Project Overview
KubeFlowOps is an iterative and extensible Kubernetes Operator that simplifies the management of complex applications. The project is structured to allow continuous improvements and additions, making it a versatile tool for DevOps teams.

The operator is built using Golang and leverages Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to automate workflows such as scaling, backups, and multi-cluster management. The project also includes a web-based user interface and integrates with Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring, as well as ArgoCD for GitOps workflows.

## Features
- **Custom Resource Management:** Define and manage custom resources to streamline application lifecycle management.
- **Automated Scaling:** Automatically scale applications based on custom metrics.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Implement automated backup and recovery procedures for stateful applications.
- **Multi-Cluster Support:** Manage and deploy applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters.
- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Integrate with Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring and alerts.
- **GitOps Integration:** Automate deployments using ArgoCD, ensuring a seamless GitOps workflow.
- **User Interface:** A web-based UI for easier interaction with the Operator and visualizing application states.
